## Install Lua in Windows

1. Go to the [download page](https://www.lua.org/download.html)

2. If we want to download the binary, click binary.

3. Choose the version of Lua, e.g. Lua 5.4.2 - Release 1

4. Copy the binary files to a folder, e.g. C:\Program Files\Lua

5. Change the name of lua54.exe to lua.exe. This step is not necessary. To run the script, we run 'lua xxx.lua' instead of 'lua54 xxx.lua'.

6. Edit the system environment variables and add the folder to the environment variable of path.
